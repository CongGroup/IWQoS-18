#Enabling Privacy-Preserving Header Matching for Outsourced Middleboxes

##Introduction:
This work introduces a middlebox system that can perform encrypted header matching based network functions. It leverages the latest practical primitives for search over encrypted data, i.e., searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) and order-revealing encryption (ORE). To mitigate recent inference attacks on ORE schemes, this work protects the order information during header matching inspection, and presents a rule-aware size reduction technique to achieve better performance.

We implement the prototype on Azure, and the evaluation results on real-world rulesets confirm the good performance of our design. Our design can be viewed as complementary components to be integrated with systems that support encrypted pattern matching for a more comprehensive and secure outsourced middlebox system.
